# Angular Notes

## Introduction
Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It is developed and maintained by Google.



## Key Features
- **Two-way data binding**: Synchronizes data between the model and the view.
- **Dependency Injection**: Makes it easier to manage and test dependencies.
- **Component-based architecture**: Encourages modular development.
- **Directives**: Extend HTML with custom attributes and elements.
- **Services**: Share data and logic across components.

## Installation
To install Angular CLI, use the following command:
```bash
pnpm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Creating a New Project
To create a new Angular project, use:
```bash
ng new project-name
```

## Running the Application
To run the application, navigate to the project directory and use:
```bash
ng serve
```
Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4200`.

## Useful Commands
- `ng generate component component-name`: Generates a new component.
- `ng build`: Compiles the application into an output directory.
- `ng test`: Runs unit tests.
- `ng lint`: Lints the project for code quality.
